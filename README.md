# simpleverticalslidingpanelswift-ios
A simple vertical sliding panel in Swift. I just hit this yet again another sliding panel feature in my current job. So I wanted to make a sample project that has this feature.

Update:
I've finished the sample project, it's very far from perfect. The constraints just needed to be adjusted based on your requirements, that's all. I realized that I will just used the default presentation + slide of iOS.
